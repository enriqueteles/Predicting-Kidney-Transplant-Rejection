# Predicting Kidney Transplant Rejection

## Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and experiments for the research study **Predicting Kidney Transplant Rejection**. The study focuses on using machine learning models to predict kidney transplant rejection based on clinical and donor-related features. The project explores challenges such as data limitations, class imbalance, and the need for robust feature selection.

## Methodological Challenges
Predicting kidney transplant rejection presents multiple challenges, including:
- **Limited dataset size:** The dataset does not fully capture the heterogeneity of patient populations.
- **Class imbalance:** Only 11% of the samples represent rejection (84 rejected vs. 740 non-rejected cases).
- **Overfitting risk:** High-complexity models may capture noise instead of meaningful patterns.
- **Clinical validation:** Models have not yet been validated for clinical use, but analysis provides valuable insights into the interaction of clinical and donor data.

## Synthetic Dataset
As part of this study, we provide a **synthetic dataset** based on our real-world kidney transplant dataset. The synthetic data retains statistical properties of the original dataset while preserving privacy, making it useful for research, methodological testing, and educational purposes.
